This project contains a collection of SQL queries that demonstrate various functionalities and complex operations on a music store database.

The queries are designed to showcase a strong grasp of SQL techniques, including aggregations, joins, window functions, subqueries, and more.

I have examined the dataset with SQL(pgadmin & Postgre SQL) to understand store's business growth by answering simple and complex questions based on geopgraphical growth, purchase power, total revenue, genre performance, music band popularity, best city in terms of revenue and best customer in terms of purchase rate.

This analysis will provide great insight to the stake holders to take right and effective decisions.
